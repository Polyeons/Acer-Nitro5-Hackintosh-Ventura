This is a progress report on the Hackintosh Ventura for Acer Nitro 5 AN515-51

Attempt 1
* Downloaded and created Ventura installer with new & updated EFI
* Installed Ventura, but with no full compatibility (Wifi Card Unsupported, can't use iServices)
* Used a Wifi dongle with outdated software, so I installed chris111's WIfi USB Dongle software after it asking to turn off SIP.
* After installing, rebooting into Ventura immedieatly kernel panics, couldn't figure out why.

[FAIL]

My best bet to get this hackintosh to work is replace the Wifi card for iServices.

Attempt 2
[July 11th-12th] 
* New Wifi card arrives, installed into my laptop replacing Qualcomm Atheros unsupported card.
* Used my other hackintosh to install Ventura Beta app and create a new install media.
* Recreated EFI with updated kexts, installer boots up normally.
* Installed successfully with no issues.
* Tested everything.
