This is a progress report on the Hackintosh Ventura for Acer Nitro 5 AN515-51

#Downloaded Ventura with new EFI

#Ventura boots, no full compatibility (Wifi, atleast for me)

#After turning off SIP and installed chris111's Wireless USB software, the system kernel panics immedietaly and I don't know why. (FAIL; Attempt 1)
